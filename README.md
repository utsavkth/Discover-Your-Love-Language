# Discover Your Love Language

## Overview
"Discover Your Love Language" is a web-based quiz designed to help individuals identify their primary and secondary love languages based on Dr. Gary Chapman's framework. By understanding one's love language, users can enhance their communication and relationships with others.

I often struggled to connect with colleagues, friends, family, and romantic partners (not that I had many! ðŸ˜…). Discovering Dr. Gary Chapman's book, *The 5 Love Languages*, changed my perspective on love and communication. This revelation motivated me to build a resource that would help others discover their love languages and improve their relationships in a similar way.
