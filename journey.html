        <h2>Inspiration Behind the Website</h2>
        <p>My inspiration for creating this website stems from my personal struggles with relationshipsâ€”whether with colleagues, friends, family, or even romantic partners (not that Iâ€™ve had many! ðŸ˜…). It wasn't until I read <i>The 5 Love Languages</i> by Gary Chapman that I began to understand the dynamics of love and communication. This book transformed my perspective and helped me navigate my relationships in a more meaningful way.</p>
        <p>Motivated by my own experience, I created this website to help others discover their love languages, just as I did. I believe that understanding your love language is essential for fostering healthy relationships. I encourage everyone to read Gary Chapmanâ€™s book; it's an invaluable resource for anyone looking to enhance their relationships.</p>
        <p>If you're interested in reading the book, feel free to send me an email, and I can provide you with a digital copy.</p>

        <h2>The Development Journey</h2>
        <p>Many people often ask me if this website is part of a university project or what motivated me to create it. Before launching this website, I developed a <a href="https://forms.gle/3cByYXYCje2ptQzp6" target="_blank">Google Form</a> to calculate love language results manually. As I marked each love language for every question on my iPad, I thought, "What if I could create a program or web app to automate this process?" This idea sparked the creation of my website.</p>
        <p>The journey involved multiple iterations and designs, each one refined through feedback from friends and colleagues. I am particularly grateful to <b>Alvina</b>, for whom I initially intended the entire website; her insights were invaluable in shaping the project. Special thanks also go to <b>Aaditya</b>, whose constructive feedback prompted numerous changes, particularly in the user interface and question presentation. I cannot count the number of prototypes stored on my PC!</p>
        <p>This project started as a simple design using basic HTML and CSS. After creating the Google Form, I spent about 5-6 hours developing the initial version. With a full-time job and working double shifts due to circumstances, I dedicated around 10 days to get to the current version, enhancing it with JavaScript and CSS along the way. Iâ€™m glad that I was able to accomplish this despite those challenges. To streamline feedback collection, I added a form at the end of the quiz, allowing users to share their thoughts directly with me via email. The complete changelog is available on GitHub, although earlier designs are not uploaded thereâ€”I may do so in the future to encourage others to tackle similar challenges.</p>
        

        <h2><span style="color: red;">Emphasizing Privacy and Transparency</span></h2>
        <p>Creating a website may seem daunting, with many people insisting that you need to buy a domain or set up a database. However, I proved that it can be done using GitHub and Formspree for feedback collection. I plan to continue updating this website and appreciate everyone's support and encouragement throughout this journey.</p>
        <p>One significant realization during my work with the Google Form was the importance of user privacy. I felt uncomfortable receiving personal love language results, which further motivated me to develop this website. Now, users can see their love language results as they progress through the quiz, and I have included a privacy note on the quiz page to address concerns about data collection. Some individuals even declined to participate in the Google Form quiz due to privacy worries, so I wanted to create a more transparent and respectful experience.</p>
