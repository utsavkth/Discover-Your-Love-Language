    <h1>My Journey with Love Languages</h1>

    <p>
      This project wasn‚Äôt born in a coding bootcamp or a university capstone. It was born out of frustration ‚Äî and curiosity. Frustration with how easily love gets misread, and curiosity about why some people feel so unseen even when they're deeply loved.
    </p>

    <p>
      I was always someone who cared deeply. But expressing it? That was the messy part. I stumbled across <i>The 5 Love Languages</i> by Gary Chapman, and for the first time, things clicked. It gave me a framework. A way to understand why I give love the way I do, and why sometimes‚Ä¶ it doesn‚Äôt land.
    </p>

    <p>
      I didn‚Äôt just read the book ‚Äî I felt it. I internalized it. And I wanted others to do the same. But I knew not everyone reads. Not everyone finishes books. So I built an experience instead ‚Äî a quiz that might just be the nudge people need to reflect.
    </p>

    <p>
      It started as a humble Google Form. I‚Äôd manually score people‚Äôs answers on my iPad. But then I thought ‚Äî what if I built this into something real? Something interactive? Something permanent? That‚Äôs when the idea of this site was born.
    </p>

    <p>
      Along the way, I received feedback from people I care about ‚Äî especially Alvina, who unknowingly inspired much of this work. And Aaditya, whose honest critiques helped polish it further. Every improvement you see was driven by their encouragement. I can‚Äôt even count how many prototypes I built and saved on my PC along the way. I‚Äôve documented many of the changes in a changelog on GitHub, though I haven‚Äôt uploaded the earliest designs‚Ä¶ maybe I will someday, to show others how things evolve. The journey wasn‚Äôt linear ‚Äî each prototype had its quirks, and each tweak taught me something new about user experience, design, and emotional honesty.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eventually, I added versions of the quiz tailored to different relationship stages ‚Äî one for singles, one for women in relationships, and one for men. Because love doesn‚Äôt speak the same language at every stage. And your results should reflect where you‚Äôre at.
    </p>

    <p>
      I didn‚Äôt have a budget. I didn‚Äôt have a team. Just long nights, Google searches, and a sense of purpose. I spent about 5‚Äì6 hours building the first version after the Google Form. What you see now was built over 10 days ‚Äî all while working full-time and pulling double shifts. Because once something matters, you make time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Privacy was a big one. The Google Form required people to send their results to me directly, and that didn‚Äôt sit right. Some even declined to take it because of that ‚Äî they weren‚Äôt comfortable sharing something so personal. That made me realize just how important it is to create a safe, anonymous, and respectful experience. So I built a version where no data is collected. Your results are yours. That‚Äôs how it should be.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you've made it this far, thank you. This project isn‚Äôt perfect. But it‚Äôs mine. And maybe, just maybe, it‚Äôll help you understand your heart a little better ‚Äî or someone else‚Äôs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fast forward five months later‚Ä¶ and I built something new.<br>
      A continuation. A deeper layer.<br><br>
      After love languages, I found myself asking:<br>
      <em>Why do we give love the way we do?</em><br>
      But more importantly‚Ä¶<br>
      <em>Why do we pull away when love gets too close?</em><br><br>
      That question led me to attachment theory. And once again ‚Äî I built.<br>
      If you‚Äôve ever felt like you're ‚Äútoo much,‚Äù or not enough, or just don‚Äôt know how to hold on without falling apart ‚Äî<br>
      I made <a href="https://utsavkth.github.io/Discover-Your-Attachment-Style/" class="cta-button-inline" target="_blank">üíô Discover Your Attachment Style</a> for you too.
