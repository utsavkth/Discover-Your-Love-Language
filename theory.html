      <h2 class="hero-heading">What Is Attachment Theory, Really?</h2>

      <p>
        It's more than psychology jargon. Attachment theory is the invisible thread running through how we connect, how we love, and how we protect ourselves from being hurt.
      </p>

      <p>
        It starts early — before memory even kicks in. Based on how our caregivers responded to our needs, our nervous system learned: *“Is closeness safe?” “Is love consistent?” “Can I trust people won’t leave?”*
      </p>

      <p>
        And from those early cues, we developed our emotional blueprint — the habits, fears, and patterns that still shape our relationships today.
      </p>

      <h3>So... What Are the Styles?</h3>
      <div class="centered-list">
        <ul class="clean-list">
          <li><strong>😊 Secure</strong> – You’re good with closeness, good with space. You communicate honestly and bounce back from conflict. Relationships feel safe.</li>
          <li><strong>😟 Anxious</strong> – You crave connection but constantly fear losing it. You read between the lines, seek reassurance, and sometimes lose yourself in love.</li>
          <li><strong>😶 Avoidant</strong> – You value independence and often keep people at arm’s length. Intimacy feels overwhelming. Distance feels safe.</li>
          <li><strong>😵‍💫 Fearful-Avoidant</strong> – You want love, but you fear it too. You open up, then pull away. You’re stuck in a push-pull between longing and protection.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
      <p>
        This isn't just theory. It’s the “why” behind the relationships that felt like home… and the ones that felt like chaos.
      </p>

      <div class="centered-list">
        <ul class="clean-list">
          <li>🧠 Why you replay arguments in your head a hundred times</li>
          <li>❤️ Why you fall for emotionally unavailable people</li>
          <li>🌪️ Why some relationships feel safe — and others feel like survival mode</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p>
        And here’s the thing: <strong>Your attachment style isn’t a sentence. It’s a starting point.</strong>  
        You’re not broken. You’re patterned. And patterns can shift. With awareness. With effort. With time.
      </p>

      <p>
        This quiz? It’s not the final answer. But it’s a mirror.  
        It might help you see yourself — maybe even for the first time.  
        The clinginess. The shutting down. The overthinking. The detachment.  
        All of it makes sense when you see the blueprint behind it.
      </p>

        Whether you’re here to heal, to reflect, or just to understand the way you love — I hope this is the beginning of something real.
